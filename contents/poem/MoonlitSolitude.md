# Moonlit Solitude

A silver glow upon the lake,  
Where silent waves in whispers break.  
Beneath the stars, alone, I stand,  
The world at peace, the night so grand.  

The night holds secrets, deep and vast,  
Of ancient days and moments past.  
In moonâ€™s embrace, the shadows play,  
As midnight slowly drifts away.

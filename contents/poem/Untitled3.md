#Untitled 3

Iâ€™m falling out of the reality
Like a bird plunging forcefully into the sea
Missing the beauty of the journey
Thinking about life, death and destiny
The shattered mirror of infinity is absorbing energy
Reflecting the light of everything all at once
Presenting countless versions of me.
Falling rapidly
Until the end has reached
Leaving no space for the self to be.

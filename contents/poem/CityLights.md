# City Lights

Beneath the night, the city gleams,  
In neon lights and muted dreams.  
Each window glows, a world within,  
Of stories lost and lives unseen.  

The streets alive with hurried pace,  
A dance of lights, a bustling space.  
The city lights, a starry maze,  
Guiding souls through urban haze.

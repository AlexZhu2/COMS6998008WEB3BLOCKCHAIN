# Winter’s Embrace

Soft snowflakes dance, a winter’s song,  
In silence deep, where they belong.  
Each flake unique, a fleeting grace,  
In nature’s cold and soft embrace.  

Beneath the frost, the earth lies still,  
While winds weave through the midnight chill.  
In winter’s breath, the world is new,  
A wonder draped in frosty hue.

# The River's Path

Through valleys deep, the river flows,  
In winding paths, its story grows.  
From mountain peak to ocean wide,  
It carries tales of every tide.  

Its waters sing, a gentle tune,  
Of midnight stars and afternoon.  
The river’s path, a life unplanned,  
A journey led by nature’s hand.

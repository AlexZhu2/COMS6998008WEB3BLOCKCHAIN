# The Autumn Glow

Golden leaves drift down like dreams,  
In amber fields and forest seams.  
Beneath the trees, the world slows down,  
As autumn dons her scarlet crown.  

Soft whispers ride the cooling breeze,  
Through branches bare and bending trees.  
Natureâ€™s lull, a gentle sigh,  
As seasons change and colors die.

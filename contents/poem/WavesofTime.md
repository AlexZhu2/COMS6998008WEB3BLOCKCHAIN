# Waves of Time

Upon the shore, the waves roll in,  
Each one a start, each one an end.  
They carry sands, both new and old,  
A timeless tale forever told.  

With each retreat, the beach is new,  
Yet something stays, a memory true.  
In waves of time, the past remains,  
A constant flow, a sea of chains.

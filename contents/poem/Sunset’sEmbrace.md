# Sunset’s Embrace

A canvas painted, dusk and gold,  
As day turns night and tales unfold.  
The sky ignites, a warm embrace,  
With hues that time cannot erase.  

On ocean’s edge, the colors play,  
And bid farewell to fleeting day.  
In sunset’s glow, the world is still,  
As stars awake beyond the hill.

# Echoes of Summer

Golden fields and skies so blue,  
The summer fades with morning dew.  
In whispers soft, the season sighs,  
As autumn waits with amber skies.  

The sun dips low, a softer light,  
As day turns gently into night.  
In summer's warmth, the echoes stay,  
Reminders of a brighter day.

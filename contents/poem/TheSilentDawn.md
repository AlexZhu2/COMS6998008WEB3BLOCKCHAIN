# The Silent Dawn

A hush descends as morning breaks,  
The world lies still, as nature wakes.  
In hues of blue, the light is born,  
And day arrives with gentle scorn.  

The silent dawn, a gift so rare,  
With whispered promises in the air.  
A fleeting calm, a soft release,  
A quiet song of endless peace.

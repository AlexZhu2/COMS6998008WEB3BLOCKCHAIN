# First Snow

A hush falls down as snowflakes land,  
A blanket fresh upon the sand.  
The world transformed in winter's white,  
As trees and fields don frosted light.  

Each flake unique, a fleeting gem,  
In winterâ€™s cold diadem.  
The first snow falls, a silent song,  
That winter's beauty won't last long.

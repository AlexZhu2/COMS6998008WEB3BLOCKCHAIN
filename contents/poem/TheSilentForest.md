# The Silent Forest

The trees stand tall, a solemn choir,  
Their branches reaching ever higher.  
In silent grace, they guard the land,  
A timeless watch, a steady hand.  

No sound disturbs the quiet peace,  
As shadows dance and whispers cease.  
The forest holds its secrets dear,  
A place untouched, where souls draw near.

# Whispers of Spring

In fields of green where blossoms grow,  
The gentle winds of springtime blow.  
Beneath the sun, the earth renews,  
In shades of pink and morning dews.  

Soft petals drift, a dance of grace,  
New life, new hope, fills every space.  
With every bloom, the world unfolds,  
As springtime stories are retold.

# Winds of Change

The autumn leaves are swept away,  
In gusts that mark the end of day.  
A world transformed, a fleeting scene,  
Where colors shift from gold to green.  

In every breeze, a story flies,  
Of endings, starts, and whispered sighs.  
The winds of change, forever free,  
Shape all that was and yet will be.

# Embers of Time

Flickering flames in evening’s hold,  
Stories told and secrets old.  
As embers dance, the moments fade,  
In twilight’s calm, memories made.  

Time slips by in orange and red,  
A warmth that lingers as words are said.  
In the fire’s glow, the past unwinds,  
Leaving only echoes behind.

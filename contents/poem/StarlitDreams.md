# Starlit Dreams

Above, the stars in patterns spread,  
A galaxy of silver thread.  
In quiet dark, my thoughts take flight,  
Beneath the endless starlit night.  

Each shining light, a distant song,  
Of worlds unseen and times long gone.  
In starlit dreams, I drift away,  
To realms where night outlasts the day.
